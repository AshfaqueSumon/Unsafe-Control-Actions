Presentation of Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) in a structured way. These UCAs are identified from the two controllers “Autonomous Onboard Controller (AOC) and Human Operator (HO)” during three operating phases within four autonomy levels. 
Three operating phases are:
•	Unmooring
•	Unberthing
•	Depart port
Four autonomy levels are:
•	Fully autonomous
•	Autonomous control
•	Operator assisted
•	Operator exclusive
 System-level hazards that may arise from the UCAs are mentioned here along with the system-level constraints. 
System-level hazards and system-level constraints.
H1) The ship collides with or is collided by another ship/s or object/s. (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5)	SC1) The ship must not collide or be collided by another ship/s or objects/s.
H2) The ship losses its position or intact stability. (L2, L3, L4)	SC2) The ship should not loss its position or intact stability.
H3) The ship produces inappropriate propulsion power. (L1, L2, L3, L4)	SC3) The ship must produce appropriate propulsion power.
H4) The ship approaches towards the wrong course. (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5)	SC4) The ship must approach towards accurate course.
